{{< img-post "/img" "about-jeff.jpg" "Jeff" "center" >}}

We're two software engineers living in the Pacific Northwest with our gnome Jeff, our dog Walter and our van The Vacationator. She's a converted Ford Transit with a kitchen, pop top bed, couch, and all the other accoutrements you'd find on a normal RV. We like to imagine living in the Vacationator full-time, but mostly she sits at our house while we stare longingly towards the road.
